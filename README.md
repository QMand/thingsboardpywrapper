# ThingsBoard Python Wrapper
# by: Mario Gamas @ ISQ

A simple python wrapper for ThingsBoard IoT Platform Telemetry API

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. ThingsBoard account
2. Python2.7 installed
3. PIP Dependency Management 


### Installing

To start using thingsboardpywrapper we need to first configure our credentials. Open __init__.py file and replace the following strings with yours:

```
USERNAME = 'YOUR_USER_NAME' 
PASSWORD = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'
BASE_URL = 'https://demo.thingsboard.io #for example
```

And then import thingsboard module to wherever you want to use it:

```
from thingsboard import *
```

Now we are ready to get the data from the Devices.

## How Does it Work

What this wrapper does it basically making GET requests according to our needs using two different approaches.

### #1 CREATE A DEVICE INSTANCE with a DEVICE ID
 hint: used when you already know what device you want your data from 

Go to ThingsBoard dashboard and choose a Device. Then, create a device object using its ID:

```
deviceOne = startDeviceInstance('INPUT_DEVICE_ID_HERE')
```

Now we can call methods on this device object to get the lastest datakey value:

```
print deviceOne
print deviceOne.getDataAttributes()
print deviceOne.getDataKeys()
print deviceOne.getDataValue('accelarationX')
```

Or an aggregation of values for a specific datetime interval:

```
key = 'temperature'
fromDateTime = '2017-12-18,11:26'
toDateTime = '2017-12-18,12:30'
agg = 'AVG'
print deviceOne.getDataValuesInterval(key,fromDateTime,toDateTime,agg)
```

### #2 CREATE INSTANCES FOR ALL DEVICES
 hint: used when you dont know what device you want your data from

Calling the following function will map all devices present on ThingsBoard dashboard and instantiate objects for all of them.

```
deviceList = startAllDevices() 
```

Then we can print all their information like this:

```
for i in deviceList:
	print i.id, i.token,i.entityType, i.dataKeys, i.attributes 
```

To retrieve our data we have two functions. One to get get the latest values simply by passing the device's list and the intendend datakey:

```
print searchDataValueForKey(deviceList,'humidity')
```

Another to get values for a specific time interval by passing the same parameter plus inital and final datetime:

```
print searchDataIntervalForKey(deviceList,'temperature','2017-12-18,11:26',\
	'2017-12-18,12:30','AVG')
```

Note: We assume that each datakey is unique accross all different Devices and the that the datetime format is respected.


Pushing data to thingsboard can be achieved by:

```
while True:
	temperature =random.randint(10,20)
  	humidity =random.randint(30,70)
 	data = json.dumps({'temperature': temperature,'humidity': humidity})
  	#print 'Temperature: ' + str(temperature) + ' Humidity: ' + str(humidity)
 	response =  deviceList[0].postDataValues(data)
 	print response
 	time.sleep(1)
```
